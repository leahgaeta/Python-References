    "- Unlike MATLAB, there's no need for suppression in Python. No more wearing out that semicolon button!\n",
    "- Commenting in Python is done using the #, while in MATLAB we comment with the % symbol.\n",
    "- Integers, Floats, Strings, and Booleans are data types in Python. There is no character vector like in MATLAB (which uses single quotes and can be indexed into like a numerical vector, not to be confused with strings which use double quotes and are a different data type).\n",
    "- Variables are assigned the same way, using the = sign.\n",
    "- The print() function is equivalent to the disp() function in MATLAB.\n",
    "- We can find the data type in Python by using the type() function and passing whatever variable you want to check. In MATLAB, this is similar to the class() function.\n",
    "- Mathematical operations are similar between the two languages. For instance, addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\\*), and division (/) are the same. However, EXPONENTIATION IS DIFFERENT! In MATLAB, we can use the upwards carrot (^). In Python though, we use the double asterisk (\\*\\*). Do not use the carrot operator for exponentiation, unless you love pulling out your hair while debugging your program.\n",
    "    - For example, x = 5 \\*\\* 2 in Python is equivalent to x = 5 ^ 2; in MATLAB."
