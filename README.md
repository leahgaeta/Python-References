## Python References

These are some Python resources for learning, as well as examples of mining datasets and modeling!

This repo includes notes on functions, file i/o, webscraping, and cleaning data. It also includes two data science projects: one using logistic regression ([Admissions project](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Python-References/blob/master/Admissions%20Project.ipynb)) and the other using various models such as random forest regression, KKN regression, and OLS to predict winning patterns for MLB teams ([MLB Win project](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Python-References/blob/master/MLB%20Win%20Project.ipynb)).

Hopefully more fun will be added in the future! :)
