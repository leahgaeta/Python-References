## Python References

These are some Python resources for learning, as well as examples of mining datasets and modeling!
This repo includes notes on functions, file i/o, webscraping, and cleaning data. It also includes two data science projects: one using logistic regression (Admissions project) and the other using various models such as random forest regression, KKN regression, and OLS to predict winning patterns for MLB teams (MLB Win project).

Hopefully more fun will be added in the future! :)
